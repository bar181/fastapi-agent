# Implementation Log - Math Agent

This log tracks the implementation of a single file math agent that demonstrates more complex functionality than the basic hello_world agent. The agent will include token-based authorization and safe mathematical expression evaluation.

## Overview
The implementation will create a math agent that:
- Requires a valid token ("MATH_SECRET") for authorization
- Safely evaluates mathematical expressions
- Provides clear documentation for direct usage
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Follows the established single-file agent pattern

Steps will be logged here as they are completed, following the implementation plan in plans/2-single-file-agent.md.

## Step 1: Design the Math Agent - COMPLETED
- Designed authorization system using hard-coded token
- Defined expression evaluation approach with safety measures
- Specified global variables (TOKEN, EXPRESSION) for configuration
- Outlined error handling and validation requirements
- Created clear usage examples and documentation structure

## Step 2: Create the Math Agent File - COMPLETED
- Created agents/math.py with:
  - Token-based authorization (MATH_SECRET)
  - Safe expression evaluation using AST parsing
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Clear documentation and usage examples
- Successfully tested core functionality:
  - Token validation working correctly
  - Mathematical expressions evaluated safely
  - Invalid expressions handled appropriately
  - Security measures preventing code injection

## Step 3: Integrate with FastAPI Endpoint - COMPLETED
- Updated main.py to handle token and expression parameters
- Successfully tested endpoint integration:
  - Endpoint accepts token and expression via query parameters
  - Math agent correctly evaluates expressions (e.g., 3*(4+2) = 18)
  - Token validation working through the API
  - Error handling properly integrated

## Step 4: Testing and Validation - COMPLETED
- Added comprehensive test suite in tests/test_agents.py:
  - Test valid token and expression evaluation
  - Test invalid token handling
  - Test invalid expression handling
  - Test missing parameters
- Updated requirements.txt with testing dependencies
- All tests passing successfully

## Step 5: Documentation and Final Review - COMPLETED
- Updated Implementation Guide with:
  - Detailed math agent documentation
  - API usage examples with curl commands
  - Direct code usage examples
  - Security features overview
- Performed final code review:
  - Code follows best practices
  - Documentation is clear and comprehensive
  - Error handling is robust
  - Security measures are properly implemented

## Implementation Complete
The Math Agent has been successfully implemented with:
- Token-based authorization
- Safe mathematical expression evaluation
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear documentation
- FastAPI integration

The system is ready for use and can serve as a template for future complex agents.
