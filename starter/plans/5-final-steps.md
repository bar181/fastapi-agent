# Final Steps Plan Document

This document outlines the final tasks and updates needed to complete the FastAPI Agent System. The goals for this phase are to refine and expand the API endpoints, update the documentation, and finalize repository details (including the README and license).

---

## 1. Update API Endpoints

### A. Separate Routes for Each Agent

In addition to the generic `/agent/{agent_name}` endpoint, add dedicated endpoints for each agent to provide detailed instructions and parameter requirements. For example:

- **Echo Agent (`/agent/echo`):**
  - **Description:** Returns an echo message.
  - **Parameters:** No additional parameters.
  - **Instructions:** Simply call this endpoint to receive the echo response.

- **Time Agent (`/agent/time`):**
  - **Description:** Returns the current (hard-coded) time.
  - **Parameters:** No additional parameters.
  - **Instructions:** Access this endpoint to see the current server time.

- **Joke Agent (`/agent/joke`):**
  - **Description:** Returns a random joke from a hard-coded list.
  - **Parameters:** No additional parameters.
  - **Instructions:** Call this endpoint for a fun, random joke.

- **Quote Agent (`/agent/quote`):**
  - **Description:** Returns an inspirational quote.
  - **Parameters:** No additional parameters.
  - **Instructions:** Visit this endpoint to get a motivational quote.

- **Math Agent (`/agent/math`):**
  - **Description:** Evaluates a math expression after verifying a hard-coded token.
  - **Parameters:** 
    - **TOKEN:** Must be set to `"MATH_SECRET"`.
    - **EXPRESSION:** A valid arithmetic expression (e.g., `"3 * (4 + 2)"`).
  - **Instructions:** Before calling this endpoint, set the global variables (`TOKEN` and `EXPRESSION`) in the agent file or via tests. The agent returns the evaluated result if the token is valid.

- **Classifier Agent (`/agent/classifier`):**
  - **Description:** Classifies input text into categories (e.g., Greeting, Question, Command, or Statement) based on keywords and patterns.
  - **Parameters:** 
    - **INPUT_TEXT:** Set this global variable to the text you want classified.
  - **Instructions:** Set `INPUT_TEXT` to your desired text before invoking this endpoint. The agent returns a classification and a confidence score.

- **Summarizer Agent (`/agent/summarizer`):**
  - **Description:** Summarizes a block of text.
  - **Parameters:** 
    - **TEXT_TO_SUMMARIZE:** Set this global variable to the text you wish to summarize.
  - **Instructions:** Define the text to summarize before calling the endpoint. The agent returns a concise summary and an explanation of its process.


 - add the hello-world and goodbye agents to the list - include appropriate descriptions
### B. Endpoint to List All Agents

Create an endpoint (e.g., `/agents`) that returns a list of all available agents with brief details for each. This endpoint should:
- Return a JSON array with each agent's name and a short description.
- Serve as a directory for users to know which agents are available and what parameters each expects.

**Example Endpoint Implementation:**

```python
@app.get("/agents")
async def list_all_agents():
    """
    Returns a list of all available agents with brief descriptions and instructions.
    """
    agents_info = [
        {
            "name": "echo",
            "description": "Returns an echo message.",
            "instructions": "Call /agent/echo with no additional parameters."
        },
        {
            "name": "time",
            "description": "Returns the current (hard-coded) server time.",
            "instructions": "Call /agent/time with no additional parameters."
        },
        {
            "name": "joke",
            "description": "Returns a random joke.",
            "instructions": "Call /agent/joke with no additional parameters."
        },
        {
            "name": "quote",
            "description": "Returns an inspirational quote.",
            "instructions": "Call /agent/quote with no additional parameters."
        },
        {
            "name": "math",
            "description": "Evaluates a math expression after verifying a token.",
            "instructions": "Ensure TOKEN is set to 'MATH_SECRET' and EXPRESSION is defined before calling /agent/math."
        },
        {
            "name": "classifier",
            "description": "Classifies input text using advanced rule-based logic.",
            "instructions": "Set INPUT_TEXT to the text you want classified before calling /agent/classifier."
        },
        {
            "name": "summarizer",
            "description": "Summarizes a block of text.",
            "instructions": "Set TEXT_TO_SUMMARIZE before calling /agent/summarizer."
        }
    ]
    return {"agents": agents_info}
```

> **Note:** Keep the generic endpoint `/agent/{agent_name}` for backward compatibility and dynamic loading.

## 2. Update Documentation (/docs Folder)

### A. Read and Update Documentation Files

- **Implementation_Guide.md:**  
  - Update the guide to include the new dedicated endpoints for each agent.
  - Add parameter details and usage examples for the math, classifier, and summarizer agents.


- **Technical_Specifications.md:**  
  - Include the new endpoints with parameter descriptions.
  - Outline the behavior of each dedicated endpoint.
  - Document the updated endpoint structure.
  - Describe the addition of the `/agents` endpoint that lists all agents.

- **Testing_and_Validation.md:**  
  - Update test coverage details to include the new endpoints and the `/agents` listing.
  - Provide sample test cases for each dedicated route.
    - Revisit any security implications, especially for agents requiring a token (like the math agent).

### B. License

- **Add MIT License:**  
  - Update the README to include a license section.
  - Include the MIT License text in a `LICENSE` file at the repository root.
  - The README should state, "This project is licensed under the MIT License."

  - Ensure that all endpoints (both generic and dedicated) work as expected.
  - Verify that the `/agents` endpoint correctly lists all available agents with descriptions and instructions.
  
- **Code Quality Check:**  
  - Review all new code for adherence to coding standards.
  - Confirm that inline comments clearly explain usage, especially for agents requiring parameters.
  
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure that all files in the `/docs` folder are updated and reflect the current system design.
  - Double-check that the README includes all necessary instructions and the MIT License information.
