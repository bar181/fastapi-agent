# Log for Step 1: Environment Setup and Refactoring

This log documents the implementation of Step 1 from the Implementation Guide, which focuses on environment setup and application refactoring for MCP integration.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Environment Setup

- Installed additional dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

- Created `.env` file with required environment variables:
  ```
  MCP_API_KEY=your_mcp_api_key
  MCP_ENDPOINT=https://your-mcp-endpoint.com/api
  ```

- Updated `.env.sample` to include the new environment variables

### 2. Application Refactoring

- Created `app/routes.py` to hold agent-related endpoints
- Moved agent execution logic from `main.py` to `routes.py`
- Updated `main.py` to initialize the FastAPI app and include routes from `routes.py`
- Implemented the MCP adapter in `app/mcp_adapter.py`

### 3. Endpoint Updates

- Refactored dynamic agent endpoint to accept POST requests at `/agents/{agent_name}`
- Ensured direct agents are accessible via GET `/agent/{agent_name}`
- Added routes for MCP showcase agents:
  - `/agents/calculator` (POST)
  - `/agents/multi_step_reasoning` (POST)
  - `/agents/workflow_coordinator` (POST)
  - `/agents/workflow_decisioning` (POST)

## Test Results

- Initial tests for basic functionality passed successfully
- MCP agent tests require further refinement due to:
  - Duplicate route definitions in `routes.py`
  - Parameter handling inconsistencies in `workflow_decisioning_agent_route`
  - Response structure mismatches between agent implementations and test expectations

## Issues and Resolutions

### Identified Issues

1. **Duplicate Route Definitions**:
   - `/agents/multi_step_reasoning` defined twice (lines 102 and 163)
   - `/agents/workflow_decisioning` defined twice (lines 117 and 146)
   - **Resolution**: Need to remove duplicate route definitions

2. **Parameter Handling Inconsistencies**:
   - `workflow_decisioning_agent_route` has two implementations:
     - One passes `task_description` as a parameter to `run_agent` (line 129)
     - The other doesn't pass any parameters (line 159)
   - **Resolution**: Need to standardize parameter handling

3. **Response Structure Mismatches**:
   - Agent implementations return different structures than what tests expect
   - **Resolution**: Need to update either the agent implementations or the tests to ensure consistent response structures

### Documentation Updates

- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/MCP_Integration.md`
- Updated `/docs/Implementation_Guide.md` to include MCP integration details
- Created detailed implementation log in `/logs/4-mcp-transfer.md`

## Next Steps

1. Fix the identified issues in the routes and agent implementations
2. Update the tests to match the actual implementations
3. Run comprehensive tests to ensure all agents are working correctly
4. Proceed to Step 2: MCP Integration (already partially implemented)

## Summary

The environment setup and application refactoring for MCP integration is mostly complete. The basic structure is in place, including the MCP adapter and showcase agents. However, there are some issues with route duplication and parameter handling that need to be fixed before proceeding to the next step.
