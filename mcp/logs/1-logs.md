# Implementation Log - Framework Integration

## Step 1: Environment Setup - COMPLETED
- Added dependencies to requirements.txt (openai, requests)
- Configured environment variables in .env (OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, MCP_API_KEY)
- Maintained single file agents in agents/ directory

## Step 2: Refactor Application Structure - COMPLETED
- Created app/routes.py to hold agent-related endpoints
- Moved agent execution logic from main.py to routes.py
- Updated main.py to initialize the FastAPI app and include routes from routes.py

## Step 3: Update Endpoints - COMPLETED
- Refactored dynamic agent endpoint to accept POST requests at /agents/{agent_name}
- Ensured direct agents are accessible via GET /agent/{agent_name}

## Step 4: Validate and Test - COMPLETED
- Updated test suite to cover both GET and POST endpoints
- All tests passing (19 tests, 10 warnings)

## Summary
The framework integration has been completed successfully. The system now supports both direct agent calls via GET /agent/{agent_name} and dynamic agent execution via POST /agents/{agent_name}.
