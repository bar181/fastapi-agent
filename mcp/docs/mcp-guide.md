
# MCP Implementation Guide

This document provides an overview and implementation guidelines for integrating the MCP (Module Context Protocol) Framework with a FastAPI/Python backend. It includes references to the source repository, pseudocode examples, and an analysis of how MCP can be adapted for use in a backend environment.

---

## 1. Overview

The MCP Framework (available at [QuantGeekDev/mcp-framework](https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/mcp-framework)) is designed to enable modular context sharing and dynamic module communication. Although its primary implementation appears geared toward front-end or JavaScript/TypeScript environments, its protocol is language agnostic. This means that—with the right adapter—it can be integrated into a FastAPI/Python application.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** To provide a standardized way to pass context between modules (agents) and manage inter-module communication.
- **Current Implementation:** The repository primarily targets front-end usage.
- **Adaptability:** With custom wrappers/adapters, MCP can be used in a Python backend such as FastAPI.

## 2. Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the MCP Framework Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/mcp-framework.git
   ```

2. **Review the Source Documents:**

   The repository includes documentation and examples that describe the MCP protocol, including:
   - Protocol specification
   - Example usage in a JavaScript/TypeScript context
   - API endpoints and message formats

3. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed along with FastAPI and Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv requests
   ```

   *Note: The `requests` library is used for HTTP calls in our Python adapter.*

## 3. Integrating MCP with FastAPI and Python

Since the MCP Framework is primarily built for front-end use, integrating it with FastAPI requires creating a Python adapter that wraps the MCP protocol’s functionality. The adapter will handle sending context to, and receiving responses from, an MCP endpoint.

### A. Creating a Python MCP Adapter

Below is pseudocode for a simple MCP adapter:

```python
import requests

class MCPAdapter:
    def __init__(self, endpoint: str, api_key: str):
        self.endpoint = endpoint.rstrip('/')
        self.api_key = api_key

    def send_context(self, context_data: dict) -> dict:
        """
        Sends context data to the MCP endpoint.
        """
        url = f"{self.endpoint}/send"
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"}
        payload = {"context": context_data}
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

    def get_response(self) -> dict:
        """
        Retrieves the response from the MCP endpoint.
        """
        url = f"{self.endpoint}/response"
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

### B. Using the MCP Adapter in FastAPI

In your FastAPI application, you can integrate the MCP adapter as follows:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from mcp_adapter import MCPAdapter  # Assuming you saved the above class in mcp_adapter.py

app = FastAPI(title="MCP-Enabled Agent System")

# Initialize the MCP adapter (update with your endpoint and API key)
mcp = MCPAdapter(endpoint="https://mcp.example.com/api", api_key="YOUR_MCP_API_KEY")

@app.post("/mcp/send")
async def send_context(context: dict):
    try:
        result = mcp.send_context(context)
        return {"status": "success", "result": result}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/mcp/response")
async def get_mcp_response():
    try:
        result = mcp.get_response()
        return {"status": "success", "result": result}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

This example demonstrates:
- **Sending Context:** A POST endpoint (`/mcp/send`) that forwards context data to the MCP system.
- **Receiving a Response:** A GET endpoint (`/mcp/response`) that retrieves a response from the MCP system.

## 4. Source Documents and Pseudocode Summary

**Source Documents:**
- [MCP Framework Repository](https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/mcp-framework)
- Protocol documentation and examples within that repository.

**Pseudocode Summary:**
1. **MCP Adapter:**
   - Initialize with endpoint and API key.
   - Provide methods `send_context()` and `get_response()` using HTTP requests.
2. **FastAPI Integration:**
   - Create endpoints to call adapter methods.
   - Handle exceptions and return JSON responses.

## 5. FAQ: MCP with FastAPI and Python

**Q:** Does the MCP Framework work with FastAPI and Python?  
**A:**  
The MCP Framework from QuantGeekDev is primarily implemented for front-end use (in JavaScript/TypeScript). However, its underlying protocol is language agnostic. By creating a Python adapter—as shown above—you can integrate MCP functionality into a FastAPI application. This allows you to use MCP features on the backend, even though the original framework is front-end–oriented.

## 6. Conclusion

By following this guide, you can adapt the MCP Framework for use with FastAPI and Python. The provided pseudocode and integration examples serve as a starting point for building more complex, context-aware agent systems that leverage the MCP protocol. Further customization and error handling may be required based on your specific use case and MCP server implementation.
